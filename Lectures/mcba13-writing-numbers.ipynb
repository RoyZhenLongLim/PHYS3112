    "# Writing numbers with uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the uncertainty (or error) in a number should be quoted to 1 or 2 significant figures. If you use scientific notation, with significant trailing zeroes, you can't go wrong. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1.23\\pm0.01\\times10^{-6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1.2300\\pm0.0017\\times10^{-6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how we quote the number and its uncertainty to the same number of digits after the decimal point. Note also that trailing zeroes are significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial point is that all the digits (both in the number and the uncertainty) need to be _significant_ in the sense that they convey useful information. It is very rarely justified in undergraduate laboratory experiments to use more that 2 digits for the uncertainty, since the uncertainty itself is usually not that well determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implied uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't explicitly indicate an uncertainty, then the _usual_ assumption is that the last digit has an error of $\\pm0.5$. The exception is with trailing zeroes before the decimal point. For example, 123 means $123.0\\pm0.5$, 120 means $120\\pm5$, 120.0 means $120.00\\pm0.05$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to write a number such as 1200, where all the trailing zeroes are actually significant, then it is best to write $1.200\\times10^{3}$, else the assumption is that 1200 is $1200\\pm50$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is some ambiguity with implied uncertainties. For example, if someone told you that the temperature was 20C, then you would reasonably assume that the trailing zero _is_ significant. And if an aircraft reports that it is flying at 10,000 feet, then air traffic controllers would reasonably assume that it was in the range $10,000\\pm80$ feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative ways of writing uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you will see numbers written like this: 1.2334(18), which means the same as $1.2334\\pm0.0018$. Also, sometimes the uncertainty interval is asymmetrical, so you might see $1.2334+0.0008-0.0013$ or $1.2334^{+0.0008}_{-0.0013}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keeping digits in intermediate calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "In intermediate calculations it is acceptable to keep a few more digits than are strictly justified by the uncertainty, but just don't get too carried away.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limits of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "A common task is to measure a distance with a ruler with 1mm markings. In this case it is acceptable to write numbers such as $12\\pm0.5$mm. This is probably clearer than writing $12.0\\pm0.5$mm. With sufficient care though, it is possible to interpolate a ruler with 1mm markings to better than 1mm. If the ruler is a metal one, and the temperature is about 20C, then you may be justified in quoting a measurement to 0.1mm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unacceptable in a laboratory report\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The distance was 120mm.\" *You should quote an uncertainty.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The distance was $120.1\\pm0.2$, which is an error of 0.1665%.\" *You can't quote 4 significant figures on the percentage error, when the error itself only has one significant figure. Also, you should specify the units.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The distance was $120.12423\\pm0.16362$mm.\"  *Too many digits.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x = 1.23488282827cm.\" *No uncertainty, and almost certainly too many digits.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The mass of a fully loaded A380 aircraft is 560,000 kg. If we added a 120 gram weight to it, it would weigh 560,000.120 kg.\" *Clearly ludicrous.*"
