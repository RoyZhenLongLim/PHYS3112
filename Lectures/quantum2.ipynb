    "# Quantum measurements lecture 2: quantum tomography of ensembles\n",
    "<b>Dr. Matthew House <matthew.house@unsw.edu.au></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic problem that arises when studying a quantum system experimentally is to determine its state in terms of measureable quantities like position and momentum. Classically, this can be a straightforward problem: for a single particle if we can measure both the position $\\vec{x}$ and momentum $\\vec{p}$, we know everything about it. Determining the state only becomes an \"interesting\" problem to solve if the information we can acquire about the system is incomplete. <b>Tomography</b> is the process of determining the full state of a system from limited information. For example, it might be reconstructing a three-dimensional object from a set of two-dimensional images, or reconstructing a crystal structure from Bragg diffraction interference patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we study quantum systems, we can never gain full information about the state of the system from a single measurement, for two reasons. The first is that when we perform a measurement, we \"collapse the wavefunction\" to a single value, which doesn't tell us very much about what the overall wavefunction looked like before we performed the measurement. The second complication is that the position and momentum of a particle, or any other pair of non-commuting observables, must obey the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,\n",
    "$$\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{4}.$$\n",
    "The system is never in a definite state of both position and momentum, and furthermore a measurement of one of these will destroy information about the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "How then can we characterise what the state of the system was before any measurements were made? How do we choose a set of measurements that will reveal complete information about the system? Addressing these questions is the subject of <b>quantum state tomography</b>."

    "A beam of silver atoms was directed through an inhomogeneous magnetic field, which deflected the atoms depending on their angular momentum. They observed two bright spots in their detector where atoms landed, one corresponding to angular momentum (or spin) $+\\hbar/2$ and one for $-\\hbar/2$ in the $\\vec{z}$ direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the historical experiment, the atoms were prepared in an oven which ejected the atoms with a completely random spin, so exactly 50% of them were \"spin up\" and 50% \"spin down\". But you might realise that they would have seen the same outcome if the spins were always completely polarised so that they pointed in the $\\vec{x}$ direction. A spin pointing in the $+x$ direction is also an equal superposition of pointing in the $\\pm z$ directions:\n",
    "$$\\left| +_x \\right> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\left| +_z \\right> + \\left| -_z \\right> \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A measurement of this spin state along the z direction will yield $+\\hbar/2$ 50% of the time and $-\\hbar/2$ 50% of the time, just as was observed in the original experiment. What if we asked the question whether the atoms coming out of the oven were truly random? With only one measurement, we can't distinguish between a completely random spin state and one which is always pointing in the $x$ or $y$ direction. To learn more, we must perform multiple measurements, for example by rotating the magnets in the experiment so that they measure the atoms spin along a different axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, we will always require more than one measurement to fully characterise the system."

    "## Ensembles \n",
    "The fact that we need to perform multiple measurements means we cannot perform tomography on a single particle, because each measurement modifies the state of the particle, destroying information about it. The best we can do is to make an *ensemble* of many particles, which have all been prepared in the same way (such as many atoms ejected from the same oven), then perform each measurement on a subset of the ensemble. So quantum state tomography is always about characterizing an *ensemble* of particles. Let's stop and introduce the terms and mathematical formalisms we use to describe an ensemble. I will continue to use the spin-½ system as an example, but the description applies generally to any quantum system.\n",

    "Estimating the density matrix for an ensemble of individual spin-½ may have made the problem of quantum state tomography seem a bit too easy. But there are several things we should consider. One is, what happens if the system we want to study is two spin-½ particles, which may be entangled with one another. Now there are four orthogonal quantum states, $++, +-, -+, --$, so the density matrix is 4x4 complex elements. After accounting for the fact that it must be Hermitian and have trace 1, there are still 15 independent numbers required to describe the whole matrix:\n",

    "So to do tomography on such a system we will need to perform at least 15 orthogonal measurements, and invert a linear system of 15 equations with 15 unknowns. This is still reasonable, and many labs have done experiments like this. But it is not scaling well for us: next, if there are three spins we will need an 8x8 density matrix which has 63 independent parameters. A system of four spins has a 16x16 density matrix with 255 independent parameters. In general, a system of $N$ spins requires about $2^N$ numbers to describe the density matrix, which grows out of control very quickly. By the time we reach a system of about 100 spins, the amount of memory it would take to even store the density matrix exceeds all of the computer memory humans have ever produced. \n",

    "But think about that for a moment: 100 tiny microscopic particles in an entangled quantum state may contain more information than all the computers in the world combined. This is either a huge problem or a huge opportunity. Because what if we could *use* all of that quantum complexity to store information, we would have a tiny microscopic system with more storage capacity than all the computers in the world today. Plus, if we wanted to double its information capacity we would simply need to add one more spin to the system (if you want to double the memory of a classical computer, you must double the number of transistors!). The promise of using quantum systems to store and manipulate information is the motivation behind the field of **quantum computing**.  \n",

    "Quantum state tomography is an important tool for quantum information scientists. But it is really only practical on small systems. Performing full state tomography on a system of just a few spins is very time consuming, and we know that we will not be able to perform full tomography on larger quantum systems. **Quantum state verification and validation** is now an important subfield of research, which looks at ways of characterising large quantum systems with limited numbers of measurements.
