# Optical Fibres (OF)

Author of this peer review (name): Roy Lim
Author of the lab report being reviewed (name): Marcus Tsui
Expected mark based on the final report rubric (/10): 7

TBH only thing holding you back was that you was that you didn't finish experiment 1.
I think the highest you can get is 7 if you can get since you haven't completed everything.
Otherwise its a 9-10 in my eyes.

## Areas Done Well

- Report is pretty and well written in LaTeX
- Theory is very thorough
  - References sources
  - Goes through the learning goals very well
- Results
  - Results were presented clearly 
  - Error were discussed appropriately

## Areas For Improvement

- Experiment 1 was missing so can't comment
- Was spot size included somewhere? Couldn't find it and was included in teh Lab Summaries
- Uncertainty
  - Should how uncertainty was computed (e.g. give me what formula you used if you intend to use that instead of 3 repetitions and using max - min / 2)
- Structure
  - Clearly differentiate between background, method, results and discussion in your report (it just feels like one long paragraph on your experiment)

## Suggestions 

Include your Jupyter Notebooks and lab book in final report
